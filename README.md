# GOTTH+

An opinionated, secure, production-ready starting point for the **GOTTH** stack: **Go**, **Templ**, **Tailwind CSS** and **HTMX**, plus a little **Alpine.js** for client-only state.

No Node, no npm, no bundler. Tailwind is the standalone CLI, and the three browser libraries are plain files downloaded by a shell script.

## What you get

- `net/http` server with timeouts, graceful shutdown and structured logs that carry a request ID
- Security middleware: strict Content-Security-Policy (no inline scripts, no `unsafe-eval`), HSTS in production, double-submit-cookie CSRF, cross-origin protection, per-IP rate limiting, request body limits
- Brotli/gzip compression
- Layered layout (`model` → `repository` → `service` → `factory`/`handler` → `view`) on SQLite and GORM
- Toasts and a spinner as Templ components, and htmx error handling that shows a toast instead of failing silently
- `hx-optimistic` wired up, with rollback on server errors
- A dev-only `/seed` route and a script that runs it with a valid CSRF token
- Unit, integration and Playwright end-to-end tests
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` guidance for AI coding agents

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+ and a C compiler (the SQLite driver uses CGO)
- [`templ`](https://templ.guide/quick-start/installation): `go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest`
- The [Tailwind CSS standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) (v4) on your `PATH` as `tailwindcss`
- `git`, `curl` and `make`
- Optional: [`air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air)

### Setup

```bash
make setup    # creates .env, downloads Go modules and the JS libraries, generates templ + CSS
make dev      # live reload; open http://localhost:7331
```

`make run` starts the server without live reload on the port in `.env` (3000 by default). `make help` lists every target.

### The JavaScript libraries

htmx, the Alpine.js CSP build and `hx-optimistic` are **not** included in this template. `make js` (`./download-js.sh`) downloads the latest version of each into `static/js` and prints its SHA-384 hash. It resolves versions from each project's git tags; pin one with `HTMX_VERSION=2.0.11 ./download-js.sh` (likewise `ALPINE_VERSION`, `HX_OPTIMISTIC_VERSION`). htmx stays on its 2.x line unless you set `HTMX_MAJOR`.

`.gitignore` excludes `static/js/*.min.js` so the template itself stays free of them. In your own project, remove that line and commit the files, so production serves copies you have pinned and reviewed.

### Seed data

With the server running in development:

```bash
make seed     # POST /seed with a valid CSRF token; loads seedData.json
```

## Project structure

```
cmd/server/         entry point: config, routes (newMux), middleware chain (buildHandler), shutdown
internal/
  config/           environment loading and validation
  csrf/             double-submit-cookie CSRF protection
  database/         SQLite connection (GORM)
  dto/              validated request shapes
  escaper/          SQL LIKE wildcard escaping
  factory/          handler constructors (closures over dependencies)
  handler/          struct-based handlers (health check)
  helper/           generic helpers (Ternary, Count)
  middleware/       security headers, rate limit, compression, body limit, admin key
  model/            domain types
  optimistic/       hx-optimistic config builders
  repository/       data access behind interfaces, sentinel errors, pagination
  requestid/        request IDs in headers and logs
  seed/             the /seed route's logic
  service/          business logic
  styles/           shared Tailwind class strings
  view/             .templ components (and generated *_templ.go)
static/
  input.css         Tailwind entry point
  js/app.js         Alpine store and components, htmx hooks
  font/  icon/      your self-hosted fonts and icons
download-js.sh      downloads htmx, Alpine (CSP) and hx-optimistic
seed.sh             runs POST /seed with a CSRF token
seedData.json       sample data
```

## Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Splash page |
| POST | `/hello` | Example app: greeting fragment |
| GET | `/healthz` | Health check (pings the database) |
| POST | `/seed` | Load sample data (development only) |
| GET | `/static/*` | Static assets |

## Testing

```bash
make test          # unit + integration (real routes and middleware, throwaway SQLite database)
make e2e-install   # once: downloads Chromium for Playwright-Go
make test-e2e      # the example app in a real browser
make check         # generate, format, vet, test
```

The end-to-end tests are behind the `e2e` build tag, so `go test ./...` needs no browser.

## Removing the example app

The example app (the hello form and the counter) is confined to:

- `internal/view/example.templ` (and its generated `example_templ.go`), and the `@ExampleApp()` line in `internal/view/pages.templ`
- `internal/factory/example.go`
- the `POST /hello` route and `greetingSvc` in `cmd/server/main.go`
- `GreetingService` in `internal/service/service.go` (and `service_test.go`) and `HelloRequest` in `internal/dto/dto.go`
- the `counter` component in `static/js/app.js`
- the hello and counter tests in `cmd/server/integration_test.go` and `cmd/server/e2e_test.go`

`model.Example`, `repository/example.go` and `seedData.json` are placeholders for the seed route; rename them to your first real model.

## Production notes

- Set `GoEnv=production`. That enables HSTS, `Secure` cookies, JSON logs and strict rate limits, and unregisters `/seed`.
- Serve behind HTTPS. The rate limiter keys on the TCP peer address, so behind a reverse proxy put real-IP handling in front of it or rate-limit at the proxy.
- Commit the downloaded JS libraries and build `static/output.css` in your deploy step.
- See `AGENTS.md` for the full conventions and security checklist.
